1.What are operators in Python?
Operators are special symbols that perform various operations on values or variables. 
They are used to manipulate data and perform calculations.

2.Differentiate between the '==' operator and the 'is' operator.
The '==' operator is used to compare the values of two objects for equality, 
while the 'is' operator is used to compare the memory location (identity) of two objects to check if they are the same object.

3.Explain the difference between unary, binary, and ternary operators.
Unary operators operate on a single operand, such as -x or not y.
Binary operators operate on two operands, like x + y or a * b.
Ternary operators are unique to Python and are represented as x if condition else y. 
They provide a shorthand way of writing conditional expressions.

4.What is operator overloading?
Operator overloading allows you to define how operators work for user-defined classes. 
For example, you can define how the + operator should behave for instances of a custom class.

5.How can you achieve operator overloading in Python?
Operator overloading is achieved by defining special methods in a class, 
such as __add__ for the + operator, __sub__ for the - operator, etc.

6.Explain short-circuiting in Python with regards to logical operators.
Short-circuiting occurs when the evaluation of a logical expression stops as soon as the result is known. 
For example, in the expression x and y, if x is False, the result is already determined to be False regardless of 
the value of y, so y is not evaluated.

7.What is the purpose of the // operator in Python?
The // operator is used for floor division, which performs division and then rounds down the result to the nearest whole number.

8.Describe the in operator and provide an example of its usage.
The in operator is used to check if a value exists within a sequence, such as a list, tuple, or string.
Example: 5 in [1, 3, 5, 7] returns True.

9.Explain the += operator with an example.
The += operator is used to add the right operand to the left operand and assign the result to the left operand. 
Example: x += 5 is equivalent to x = x + 5.

10.What is the difference between the or operator and the | operator?
The or operator performs a logical OR operation on boolean values and short-circuits, 
whereas the | operator performs a bitwise OR operation on integers.
